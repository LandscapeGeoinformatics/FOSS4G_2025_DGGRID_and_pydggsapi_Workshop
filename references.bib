	abstract = {Abstract. Discrete Global Grid Systems (DGGS) are spatial reference systems that use a hierarchical tessellation of cells to partition and address the globe and provide alternative spatial data format and indexing methods as compared to traditional vector and raster spatial data. In order to effectively use DGGS, functional software needs to be available and data needs to be indexed into a DGGS. We compare the software APIs of the 5 main open-source DGGS implementations – Uber H3, Google S2, rHEALPix by Landcare Research New Zealand, RiskAware OpenEAGGR, and DGGRID by Southern Oregon University – and present exemplary workflows for converting spatial and vector and raster datasets into DGGS-indexed format. We summarize, that Uber H3 and Google S2 provide more mature software library functionalities and DGGRID provides excellent functionality to construct grids with desired geometric properties and to load point data but does not provide functions for traversal and navigation within a grid after its construction.},

Elaborating on the work of Calabretta and Roukema [Mapping on the HEALPix grid, Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society 381 (2007), no. 2, 865–872.], we also rearrange the HEALPix map projection and build a new DGGS on top of it, which we call the rHEALPix DGGS. The rHEALPix DGGS has all the key features of the HEALPix DGGS, making it excellent for applications that require harmonic analysis. Additionally, its planar projection consists of horizontal-vertical aligned nested square grids, which are easy to understand and display. We present all the formulas and algorithms necessary for a basic implementation of the rHEALPix DGGS and link to our own open source implementation.},

	abstract = {In astronomy, physics, climate modeling, geoscience, planetary science, and many other disciplines, the mass of data often comes from spherical sampling. Therefore, establishing an efficient and distortion-free representation of spherical data is essential. This paper introduces a novel spherical (global) coordinate system that is free of singularity. Contrary to classical coordinates, such as Cartesian or spherical polar systems, the proposed coordinate system is naturally defined on the spherical surface. The basic idea of this coordinate system originated from the classical planar barycentric coordinates that describe the positions of points on a plane concerning the vertices of a given planar triangle; analogously, spherical area coordinates (SACs) describe the positions of points on a sphere concerning the vertices of a given spherical triangle. In particular, the global coordinate system is obtained by decomposing the globe into several identical triangular regions, constructing local coordinates for each region, and then combining them. Once the SACs have been established, the coordinate isolines form a new class of global grid systems. This kind of grid system has some useful properties: the grid cells exhaustively cover the globe without overlapping and have the same shape, and the grid system has a congruent hierarchical structure and simple relationship with traditional coordinates. These beneficial characteristics are suitable for organizing, representing, and analyzing spatial data.},
