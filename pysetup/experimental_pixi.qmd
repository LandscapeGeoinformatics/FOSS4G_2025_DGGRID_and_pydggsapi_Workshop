## Installation

[https://pixi.sh/latest/installation/](https://pixi.sh/latest/installation/)

To install pixi you can run the following command in your terminal:

### Linux & macOS

```bash
curl -fsSL https://pixi.sh/install.sh | sh
```

If your system doesn't have curl, you can use wget:

```bash
wget -qO- https://pixi.sh/install.sh | sh
```

What does this do?

The above invocation will automatically download the latest version of pixi, extract it, and move the pixi binary to `~/.pixi/bin`. The script will also extend the `PATH` environment variable in the startup script of your shell to include `~/.pixi/bin`. This allows you to invoke pixi from anywhere.

Now restart your terminal or shell to make the installation effective.

```

What does this do?
