# 5. Setting up Jupyter Notebook

## First,test that everything works

If you don\'t have the Powershell open, please open it.
`Powershell` can be found by clicking on the Windows start menu
button and start typing `Powershell`.
MacOSX and Linux users should open theur default terminal window.

Also always make sure you
have activated your `geopython2025` environment.

``` bash
(base) micromamba activate geopython2025

(geopython2025)
```

You can test that the installations have worked by running following
commands in a Python console. At first start the Python console:

``` bash
(geopython2025) python

Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>>
```

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import shapely
import fiona
import geopandas as gpd
import cartopy
import mapclassify
import rasterio
import rasterstats
try:
    import gdal
except ImportError:
    from osgeo import gdal
```

If you don\'t receive any errors, everything should be working!

In order to close the Python interpreter type `exit()` and press `return/enter` or press
**Ctrl+Z** to exit.

Under Mac/Linux you might have to press **Ctrl+D** to exit.

``` bash
(geopython2025) >>> exit()
```

## Install IPykernel and start up Jupyter Notebook

The Jupyter Notebook server is an open-source web application that
allows you to create and share documents that contain live code,
equations, visualizations and narrative text. Uses include: data
cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling,
data visualization, machine learning, and much more. Jupyter Lab is an
extended version that allows to have several notebooks open at the same
time. We will be mostly working with Jupyter Lab.

Before we start Python coding we will make our newly created conda
Python environment known to the Jupyter notebook system by installing
the kernel, basically the execution engine link from Jupyter web
notebook to our Python environment:

Make sure you are in your dedicated working directory, your
\"geopython2025\" folder, on the Command line window (Powershell).
And make sure the `geopython2025` conda environment is activated:

``` bash
(base) micromamba activate geopython2025

(geopython2025) python -m ipykernel install --user --name geopython2025
```

That should be it. You should now be able to start the Jupyter notebook
server:

``` bash
(geopython2025) jupyter lab
```

This should open a webpage in your default webbrowser.

::: {.callout-note}
Don\'t close the console window nor the browser window where the
notebooks opened. Always use the \"File\" -\> \"Save and Checkpoint\"
and then -\> \"Close and Halt\" menu options in the notebooks, and the
\"Quit\" button on the main notebook server webpage.
